# Liddit

A lighweight web-based reddit client.

## Why

1. I want to open reddit from my computer, but the official web app feels slow and bloated with features I rarely use.
2. It's been a while since I deal with frontend development, so this is an excuse to brush up my frontend skills.

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1 (✔️)

- Browse posts in a given subreddit
- Browse replies to a post

### Milestone 2

- Loading state
- Load more replies

### Milestone 3

- Reddit OAuth integration
- Upvote & downvote
- Write replies
